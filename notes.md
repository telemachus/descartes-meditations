# Notes

## Descartes' use of scepticism (Bernard Williams)

"Descartes, whose aim is precisely to replace uncertainty with knowledge" (231). Scepticism serves two purposes for D:

1. It is an extreme example of the uncertainty that is already present in human life (231).
1. It is "part of D's method for overcoming uncertainty and achieving knowledge" (231).

D strives to create hyperbolical doubt as a positive counterweight to any danger of doubtful or poorly supported beliefs. This is a feature of his "mature method" even before his *Meditations* (231-232). This already implies that D feels that he has control of his scepticism, in a way that many other thinkers to not. Williams compares D's method to that of Ayer in *Problems of Knowledge*. He then adds, "The Cartesian, however, resembles the Pyrrhonist, in deploying a scepticism which he has intelligibly shaped to his own purposes, in the one case of satisfying the desire for knowledge, in the other of banishing it" (232).

D believes that he has met the sceptical challenge in such a way as to banish it fully. He strives to raise doubts as extreme as anything in the sceptic's arsenal, and he suggests that he is familiar with both ancient and contemporary scepticism. He hopes to prevent any later counter-attack by sceptics against the position that he goes on to develop.

Williams also argues that the extremity of D's doubt is part of *why* he can defeat scepticism: "If the ancient sceptics had persisted far enough in their doubt, they could have transcended it". Although Williams doesn't elaborate, the idea seems to be that doubt taken far enough will run aground against a certainty. And that certainty will allow (force?) one to rebuild a set of beliefs free from doubt. Williams cites Burnyeat's "Idealism and Greek Philosophy" here, and I wonder if he has in mind Burnyeat's general idea that the sceptic cannot fully live his scepticism.

Williams discerns three distinct levels of doubt in D's arguments, and he believes that D too saw these three levels. First, there are "the common illusions of the senses". These are merely a preliminary move by D. They don't hold his attention. Dreaming takes us from this first stage of common error to the idea that "on each occasion of supposed perception, one can properly think 'I might be mistaken *now*'" (234). The first type of error resists generalization, but the second type forces generalized doubt. The third and final stage goes beyond the thought that, on each particular occasion, we might be deceived to reach the radical idea that we might be deceived *on every occasion*. The (alleged) external world might be entirely an illusion. It might not exist at all, or it might be a systematic, fundamental misunderstanding (235). This radical doubt relies on and requires the thought experiment of the evil demon. D calls this last level of doubt, appropriately, "hyperbolical".

An important point is that for D, the truly serious reasons for doubt do not, and probably cannot, stem from empirical considerations. For that reason, D does not draw very heavily on the immense amount of everyday, empirical cases found in Montaigne or Sextus (236). D must reach for the extremity of the thought experiment in order to reach the level of doubt he aspires to. Where D did make use of this old material (the famous "reheated cabbage"), it was primiarly because they were "helpful in the business of getting used to thinking about corporeal things (in particular) in a certain way" (236).
