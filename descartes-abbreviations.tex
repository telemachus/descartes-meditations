% [[- Works of Descartes
References to the writings of Descartes in this book work as follows. CSM and CSMK refer to the three-volume English translation of the philosophical works and letters of Descartes. AT refers to the twelve-volume edition of the original French and Latin works and letters of Descartes. When I refer to any of Descartes's work, I will always give a double reference: first to the English and then to the original edition. So, for example, the citation ``(\textbf{CSM} I 192; \textbf{AT} VI 1)'' points to the first page of \textit{Discourse on the method} both in English and French.
