% [[- Introduction
This chapter provides a complete vocabulary for Descartes's \textit{Meditationes de prima philosophia}. Here's a brief description of the principles I followed in putting together the vocabulary as well as some important conventions.

The list should include every word in the \textit{Meditations}, no matter how basic, but I have flagged the more common or important words. If an asterisk appears in the outer left margin of an entry, that word is either (i) especially common in ancient Latin or (ii) particularly important for Descartes. In order to determine what words are especially common in ancient Latin, I relied on the ``Latin Core Vocabulary'' from the Dickinson College Commentary website \parencite{cfrancese2014}. Chrisopher Francese, the primary compiler of that list, notes that those 1,000 words cover nearly 70\% of all the forms in typical ancient Latin texts \parencite{cfrancese2013}. Any word in the DCC Latin List will have an asterisk, but I've also placed asterisks on some additional words. These aditional words fall into one of two categories: (i) cognates of words already on the DCC list or (ii) words I feel are especially common in or important for Descartes. Words with an asterisk are a great first place for students to direct their attention when learning new vocabulary.

I relied on three sources for the entries. For meanings, I used both the \textit{Oxford Latin Dictionary} and \textit{A Latin Dictionary} \parencite{old1982,lewisshort}. Since these dictionaries often leave questions about the vowel length of hidden quantities unanswered (e.g., \textit{actum} or \textit{āctum}?), I also consulted Michael Weiss's \textit{Outline of the Historical and Comparative Grammar of Latin} \parencite{weiss2011}. Within entries, commas separate synonymous meanings, and semicolons separate distinct meanings.
