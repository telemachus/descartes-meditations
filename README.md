# Commentary on Descartes’ *Meditationes de prima philosophia*

## What is this?

As of 2019, it’s a work in progress. The plan is that it will be a text and commentary on Descartes’ *Meditationes de prima philosophia*. The commentary is aimed at intermediate readers of Latin. The notes focus primarily on the language, but since I hope it will be of interest to non-philosophers as well, I also talk about the arguments.

Currently, there is an introduction, a text and commentary on the synopsis and first two meditations, and a vocabulary for the synopsis and first two meditations. (There’s also a bibliography.)

**NB** When I talk about skepticism in the introduction, I focus on Sextus Empiricus and Pyrrhonism. I now think that I should focus on Academic skepticism, particularly as seen in Cicero, since I believe that Descartes probably knew Cicero far better than he knew Sextus. But I have not yet had time to rewrite those sections of the introduction.

## Want to look at it?

The easiest way to take a look is to [download a pdf][pdf]. I won’t update the pdf all the time, but it won’t run too far behind the writing. (**NB** I just updated the pdf (June 2019) to reflect typos and errors found by my latest class.)

If you have LaTeX, you should be able to build a pdf of the document by running `make`. You’ll need a pretty recent version of LaTeX and its supporting packages.

## Want to help?

I would love feedback on anything (my terrible LaTeX, the text, or the
commentary). The most easy way to contribute is to [post an issue][issue], but
you’re also welcome to [fork and make a pull request][fork]. (Note to self: Add
something for non-technical readers about how this model works.)
