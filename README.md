# Commentary on Descartes’ *Meditationes de prima philosophia*

## What is this?

As of 2019, it’s a work in progress. The plan is that it will be a text and commentary on Descartes’ *Meditationes de prima philosophia*. The commentary is aimed at intermediate readers of Latin. The notes focus primarily on the language, but since I hope it will be of interest to non-philosophers as well, I also talk about the arguments.

## Want to look at it?

The easiest way to take a look is to [download a pdf][pdf]. I won’t update the pdf all the time, but it won’t run too far behind the writing.

If you have LaTeX, you should be able to build a pdf of the document by running `make`. You’ll need a pretty recent version of LaTeX and its supporting packages.

## Want to help?

I would love feedback on anything (my terrible LaTeX, the text, or the
commentary). The most easy way to contribute is to [post an issue][issue], but
you’re also welcome to [fork and make a pull request][fork]. (Note to self: Add
something for non-technical readers about how this model works.)
