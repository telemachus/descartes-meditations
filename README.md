# Commentary on Descartes' *Meditationes de prima philosophia*

## WARNING

I'm just starting work on this (December 2015). At the moment, nearly all of it is either TODO or proof-of-concept only. But watch this space. By January of 2017, there should be something more substantial here. (In fact, I'll be putting in the bulk of the work over summer of 2016, but the class begins in January of 2017.)

## What is this?

This repository will store LaTeX text and commentary on Descartes' *Meditationes de prima philosophia*.

If you have LaTeX, you should be able to build a pdf of the document by running `make`. If you don't want to bother with that, you can also [download pdfs from this site][pdf].

## How can I help?

I would love feedback on anything (my terrible LaTeX, the text, or the
commentary). The most easy way to contribute is to [post an issue][issue], but
you're also welcome to [fork and make a pull request][fork]. (Note to self: Add
something for non-technical Classicists about how this model works.)
