# Commentary on Descartes' *Meditationes de prima philosophia*

## What is this?

It's a work in progress. The plan is that it will be a text and commentary on Descartes' *Meditationes de prima philosophia*. The commentary is aimed at intermediate readers of Latin. The notes focus primarily on the language, but since I hope it will be of interest to non-philosophers as well, I also talk about the arguments.

Currently, there is an introduction, a text and commentary on the synopsis and first two meditations, and a vocabulary for the synopsis and first two meditations. (There's also a bibliography.)

**NB** When I talk about skepticism in the introduction, I focus on Sextus Empiricus and Pyrrhonism. I now think that I should focus on a section of Plato's *Theaetetus* and Academic skepticism, particularly as seen in Cicero. I suspect that Descartes probably knew those sources better than he knew Sextus, but I have not yet had time to rewrite those sections of the introduction.

## Want to look at it?

If you have LaTeX, you should be able to build a pdf of the document by running `make`. You'll need a pretty recent version of LaTeX and its supporting packages.

If you want to look at it, but you aren't comfortable with LaTeX, send me an email (peter@aronoff.org) or contact me on Twitter (@telemachus).

## Want to help?

I would love feedback on anything (my terrible LaTeX, the text, or the
commentary). Again, please send me an email or contact me on Twitter.
