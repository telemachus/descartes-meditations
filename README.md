# Commentary on Descartes' *Meditationes de prima philosophia*

## What is this?

This repository will store LaTeX text and commentary on Descartes' *Meditationes de prima philosophia*. At the moment, there's not much here, but there will be. Watch this space.

## Want to look at it?

The easiest way to take a look is to [download a pdf][pdf]. I won't update the pdf all the time, but it won't run too far behind the writing.

If you have LaTeX, you should be able to build a pdf of the document by running `make`. You'll need a pretty recent version of LaTeX and it's supporting packages, and you'll also need two fonts: [Gentium Basic][gbasic] and [Gentium Plus][gplus].

## How can I help?

I would love feedback on anything (my terrible LaTeX, the text, or the
commentary). The most easy way to contribute is to [post an issue][issue], but
you're also welcome to [fork and make a pull request][fork]. (Note to self: Add
something for non-technical readers about how this model works.)
